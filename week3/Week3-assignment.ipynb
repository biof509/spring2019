    "The assignment for __Week 3__ has 6 components. The first component is a self-test quiz. It is not graded and is provided for self checking. The next three exercises are each worth 1 point, and each of them is graded as pass or fail. In order to pass you need to implement the required functionality and pass the assert tests. If you think that some assertions are incorrect please contact us on Slack #week3, it sometimes happens. The last two exercises are not graded but we highly recommend attempting to solve them. Depending on your Python skills, they may require some documentation reading, but this is a skill you all need to develop. \n",

    "- a. A class\n",
    "- b. An object\n",
    "- c. A method\n",
    "- c. An attribute\n",

    "- b. False\n",
    "- c. Sometimes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Which statement most accurately describes the relationship between a parent and child classes?\n",
    "- a. A parent class contains the exact same code as its child.\n",
    "- b. A child class is unrelated to its parent.\n",
    "- c. A parent class inherits attributes and behavior from its child.\n",
    "- d. A child class contains code from its parent without copying it, is more specialized and can define additional attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. A well-written object class can be described as:\n",
    "- a. Has well-defined boundaries, does only a few things, and knows only about its own data.\n",
    "- b. Is largely data oriented and open to any program that needs to access it.\n",
    "- c. Has knowledge only of the other objects and classes it needs to perform its functions.\n",

    "- e. a and c\n",
    "- f. All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Which statement(s) best describes an object's attributes?\n",
    "- a. Attributes act like the nouns of an object.\n",
    "- b. Attributes describe an object's behavior.\n",
    "- c. Attributes can mean pretty much whatever you want them to mean — that's what we mean by \"open source.\"\n",

    "- e. b and c\n",

    "- a. Behavior acts like the nouns of an object.\n",
    "- b. Behavior, like attributes, can be defined however we want — that's what we mean by \"open source.\"\n",
    "- c. Behavior acts like the verbs of an object.\n",

    "- c. Sometimes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Which statement(s) best describes inheritance?\n",
    "- a. One class (the child) generalizes the attributes and behavior of another class (the parent), making the child object more generalized.\n",
    "- b. The child class inherits from its parent, adding specialized attributes and behavior.\n",
    "- c. When a child class is created, a well-known best practice is for the developer to manually copy/paste all of the source code from the parent class to ensure that nothing gets broken.\n",
    "- d. When a child class inherits from its parent, only the additional attributes and behavior must be coded, which is one of the benefits of OOP.\n",
